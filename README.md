# Data and viz of interest
1. An article that relates data science to a humanities topic that I am interested in: 

This article "Data Science and the Humanities: A Mutually Beneficial Relationship"(https://devoelmoorecenter.com/2020/11/08/data-science-and-the-humanities-a-mutually-beneficial-relationship/) describes how important the humanities is in today's data-driven world. Ethical and humanistic concerns are very important today when one collects, represents, analyzes, and visualizes data. It also mentions that given the silence of data or the omission of data, reality can be distorted and some people can be harmed and unrepresentative. Overall it is a very interesting and thoughful article to look at which relates data science to the humanities. 

2. A data visualization that I would love to know how to make with Python:

This is a dynamic visualization based on a time series. And it is also a scatterplot which is one of the most common visualization in data analyses. I find it very interesting because when we analyze datasets today, we often need to take into account the time factor to get a more complete and useful view of trends. I wish I could learn how to make such visualizations that compare two or more variables over time or other relationships.


# Ideas for data to investigate

1. Write a bulleted list of 2 or 3 humanities topics of interest.
 * Social Media/Network Analysis

 * Sentiment Analysis

2. The most appealing topic in syllabus: According on the syllabus, I found that "Stats & Modeling: Making recommendations, predictions, and arguments" was the topic that appealed to me the most. I realized that today's algorithms about recommendation systems are so powerful that basically most of the promotion of trending things relies on algorithms. Learning how to make recommendations, predictions and arguments will definitely help me improve my knowledge of data science.

3. Initial quick research about the dataset/topic above.

 a) Social Recommendation Model Based on User Interaction in Complex Social Networks:(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218957)

 b) Twitter Sentiment Extraction-Analysis, EDA, and Model Dataset on Kaggle: (https://www.kaggle.com/code/tanulsingh077/twitter-sentiment-extaction-analysis-eda-and-model)
 
 
# Ideas from curated datasets & project lists
 

1. The first interesting dataset I found was "Online Shoppers Purching Intention." This dataset documents the intention of different online shoppers within one year. Because the dataset contains a wealthy of information about the habits of online shoppers, so we can exam closely at the shopping behavior and patterns as a whole; therefore, based on the findings, we can make pridiction whether certain pages need to be changed to entice visitors to ended up place an order/ or we can make recommendations that better match consumers interests. More specific research questions and methods can be updated later. Here is the link for the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset)
2. The second dataset was the "Travel Reviews." This dataset is about traveler review ratings in 10 different categories in East Asia. Each traveler rating ranges from 4-0, which makes it easy to do relative analysis. A few things I could talk about/investigate are: a) looking at the most/least popular destinations in East Asia; b) looking at each category and comparing their average ratings; c) possibly needing additional spatial datasets to go along with a more in-depth investigation; and d) finding secondary sources to help with the previous questions.
